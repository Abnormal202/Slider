## Details

[(Old) Documentation!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wDgUfDdPVIihPnhNXAXVBCsffXykWzqlrrMu5cy8ZMs/edit?usp=sharing)

Slider was a [submission](https://randomerz.itch.io/slider-jam) to GMTK 2021. The game placed 16th by community at the end! Spring 2022, I pitched the game to Georgia Tech's Video Game Dev club, and we developed the game over the semester.

In April, the game was released on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1916890/Slider/) and in July we published a demo version of Slider.

Currently, we're looking to release Slider early 2023 and we hope you'll root for us on our journey!
